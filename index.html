      <h1>Welcome to M31Lab</h1>
      <p>
        M31Lab is a Puerto Rican startup founded in 2025, inspired by the wonder and vast potential of the cosmos. 
        Our name comes from Messier 31, the scientific designation for the Andromeda Galaxyâ€”the nearest spiral galaxy 
        to our own Milky Way and a symbol of exploration, scale, and infinite possibility.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Current Project: Kendo Go!</h2>
      <p>
        Kendo Go! is our first iOS app, designed for absolute beginners interested in the art of kendoâ€”the Japanese way of the sword. 
        Whether you're just getting started or want a quick reference at your side, Kendo Go! makes learning accessible, engaging, and fun.
      </p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <p>
        The app includes a comprehensive glossary with kanji, romaji, English, and phonetic pronunciation for essential kendo terms. 
        It also helps users learn to count in Japanese using kanji, romaji, and Arabic numerals. A built-in quiz mode offers 
        interactive learning through randomized questions that test vocabulary and numbers in multiple formats.
